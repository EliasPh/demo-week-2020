## WHAT SOCIAL CHALLENGE DOES YOUR PROTOTYPE ADDRESS? 

If there is a fire or another mission is pending, the relevant information is often sent to the fire departments and other aid organizations by fax - there is only one copy of the relevant fax and prior knowledge is required in order to extract the relevant information. The alarm display project wants to automatically evaluate this fax and visualize the most important data on a generally visible display. This means that everyone involved is on the same level of information and there are fewer misunderstandings.

## HOW DO YOU TACKLE THE PROBLEM?
The alarm display is designed to quickly display the most important information about an upcoming mission for fire departments and other aid organizations: These include, for example, the location of the emergency, destination address, vehicles moving out or free text from the alarming control center. Destination and directions can be visualized on a map and additional information - such as location data for available hydrants - enables tactical considerations even before arrival. By using free software, the financial effort is to be kept as low as possible and since there is no central server, every organization can operate the software on site. In the sense of a flexible and user-friendly application, the project is realized with web technologies.

## WHO IS YOUR TOOL AIMED AT?
The target group is formed by aid organizations, such as voluntary fire departments and other smaller organizations for which commercial offers are not profitable. */
